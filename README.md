## About this Project

Using data that was originally collected for [a series of human activity recognition papers]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones), I generate a tidy data frame in R. This dataset brings together the training and testing sets from the original experiment and aggregates mean and standard deviation values for each of the 30 subjects in six states (activity): WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING.

## Files in this project

This project consists of the following files:

* This read me file (README.md) that describes the project and its components.

* The tidy data set (Tidy_Data.rdata), details of which can be found in the Code Book (CodeBook.md).

* The code book (CodeBook.md) which describes the variables, the data, and all transformations that I performed to clean up the data.

* An R script (run_analysis.R) with all the source code for the project from getting the original files to saving the final data set in the working directory.
